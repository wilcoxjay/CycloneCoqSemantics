 This is the definition of formal syntax for Dan Grossman's Thesis, 
  "SAFE PROGRAMMING AT THE C LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION". 

   TODO Check that I have the tightest quantifiers in theorems
      as this was required in Return Preservation.

   TODO kinding is wrong, either dan mean \tau for concrete type or 
       there is an implementation or thesis bug.

   TODO design partial functions for use.
        a) as lists
        b) different syntax for show
        c) WFC, WFU, WFDG get uniqueness checks.
        d) WFD has to be added with checks also.
	e) What are the lemmas I want?
	f) How does this relate to the thesis?

   TODO think about functions vs relations for get proofs.

   TODO No uniqueness in the context wf rules. 

   TODO Think about alpha conversion.

   TODO  https://github.com/wilcoxjay/tactics

   TODO learn pose.

   TODO Should I add syntactic sugar?

   TODO get dan to answer questions.

   TODO prove everything.

   TODO think about how I should actually prove things in Coq? What's
    for free.
